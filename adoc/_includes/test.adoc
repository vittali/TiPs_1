== Test

I start a second debug session, this time with the correct initialization script.
After downloading the project to the BBB, the debugger will stop at main. Running the project
will make the LEDs on the PRU Cape blink.

Since I did not copy the project files into the workspace ( to maintain the include paths), I created
files directly in the submodule directories. Since I can't push to the submodule repo, I could now add a
new git remote to which I can push my changes.

A complete and ready to debug project `PRU_LED0` is available in the compagnion repo.
