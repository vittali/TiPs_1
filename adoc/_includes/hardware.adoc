In order to program and debug a PRU, I need:

* The BBB itself, from one of the distributors here <<r5>> or from https://www.reichelt.de[reichelt].
* The BBB comes without a {r5} connector. It must be purchased separately (see also <<r2>>, <<r3>>) and soldered on the bottom side of the BBB.
* A compatible debug probe like the {r3} which comes with the required cables.

TIP: a more powerful alternative is the {r4}.

In addition, I purchased the following optional items:

.BOM - optional items
* The {r1} is an extension board to get started with PRU programming.
* The {r2} mentioned in the <<r1>>, Fig. 54, can be used to establish a serial communication with the host.
It is not suitable for simultaneous usage with the PRU Cape, because the Cape will render the header on the BBB inaccessible.

WARNING: I made sure to get a 3.3 V version of the FTDI connector to match the voltage on the BBB.

* a standard RS232 serial monitor cable. This can be connected to the UART of the PRU cape (rather than the hidden serial header on the BBB) and
allows for serial communications with the host PC.


Before soldering the fine pitch {r5}, I wanted to refresh my soldering skills.
I found the video tutorials by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uiroWBkdFY[John Gammel] most helpful:

. don't worry about shorts until finished,
. to remove shorts, don't use solder wig, use flux.

WARNING: testing for shorts with an ohmmeter will apply a small voltage to the pins of the Sitara processor.
Strictly speaking, this voids the warranty as explained in the <<r1>>.

=== Preventing Linux from booting

The BBB comes with Linux flashed to the onboard eMMC. To prevent Linux from booting
I hold the boot switch pressed when applying power.
This switch is not easily accessible with the PRU Cape mounted.
I check that the heartbeat indicator LED does not flash as this would mean that the board is still booting.

The are many tutorials available on how not to boot from the eMMC, none of which worked for me.
So I settled for the brute force approach and erased the eMMC.

WARNING: This will completely erase the device mmcblkx, where x depends on the configuration. With no SDCard inserted
x is probably 0. I use `fdisk -l` to discover the available devices.

[listing]
.Erase the boot device - _x_ is configuration dependent
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblkx bs=2M count=2048

Now, when I apply power, only the power LED is permanently on.

NOTE: it seems as if this is still not enough. When I connect the BBB to the host, the Network Manager App periodically
shows "Connection failed" notifications.
Apparently, the BBB tries to open a Ethernet-over-USB connection, which means that at least the bootloader is still present. TODO.
