I installed CCS 9.2 from {r1} on Linux Mint 19.2.

From the CCS App Center, I installed the *PRU C compiler* option.

I cloned the {r2} as a git submodule into the compagnion repo.

[listing]
$ cd <compagnion repo dir>
$ git submodule add https://git.ti.com/cgit/pru-software-support-package/pru-software-support-package

Therefore, if I clone the companion repo, I need to say;

$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vittali/vittali.ch-bbb-jtag

=== Getting started with the Hand-on Labs

Based on _Lab1_ from {r3}:

. When importing the project, I unchecked `Copy project into workspace`. If the project gets copied in the workspace
the _include_ definitions will be wrong and the project won't compile without modifiation.
. I did create a target configuration `BBB.ccxml`.
. I did *not* change the initialization script as explained in (8).
. I created a default Debug Configuration by starting a first debug session. This session fails because the initialization script is missing.
. I open the newly created Debug Configuration and select the initialization script _bbb_pru_startup.js_ provided in the compagnion repo:

I can now debug and test the _Lab1_ demo,
