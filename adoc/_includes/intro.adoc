The Beagle Bone Black, revC (13/2017), described in detail in the System Reference Manual {r1},
comes with the Sitara AM3358BZCZ100 processor, a SoC (system on chip) that includes a 1-Ghz
Cortex A8 processor and two independent {r2}s (Programmable Realtime Unit).
These are independent cores, specifically designed for real-time
requirements. In particular, they allow for deterministic digital I/O operations.

The BBB can provisioned in two different ways:

. installing a bootloader to boot and run a suitable Linux distribution, like TI's Proessor SDK for AM335x processors,
. opening a JTAG debug connection for example (but not restricted to) with TI's Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE.

The latter is the focus of this document.
